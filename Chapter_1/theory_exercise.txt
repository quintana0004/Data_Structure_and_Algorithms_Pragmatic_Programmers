1. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take:

a. Reading
    - Reading refers to looking at a particular spot within the data structure, in this case is a an array. 
    - An array one can look at a particular spot with the index number. 
    - The number of steps that takes to read an array is just one step. 

b. Searching for a value not contained within the array
    - To search a value that is contained in the array, it must go through each
    element in the array to make sure it's found.
    - I would say it takes 100 total number steps, because it's for an array that contains 100 elements. 

c. Insertion at the beginning of the array
    -

d. Insertion at the end of an array
e. Deletion at the beginning of the array
f. Deletion at the end of the array


2. For an array-based set containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take:

a. Reading
b. Searching for a value not contained within the array.
c. Insertion of a new value at the beginning of the set
d. Insertion of a new value at the end of the set
e. Deletion at the beginning of the set
f. Deletion at the end of the set


3. Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance 
of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value "apple" is found inside an array. How many steps would it take 
to find all the "apples"? Give your answer in terms of N.
