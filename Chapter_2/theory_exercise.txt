1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]?
    - For an linear search for the number 8 in an ordered array, once it starts to search each element of the array and finds the value will
    stop searching. The worst case scenarios is that the value is not found and still have to keep seaching. It takes a total of N steps
    depending of how fast it find a value or not.
    - As for the array presented in this exercise it will take 4 steps to find the number 8. 

2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example? 
    - In this case in binary search starts at the middle of the array and 8 happens to be the middle of the array. It will be 1 step only
    from the binary search, but if it was not an ordered array then it will be more steps. 


3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000?
    - Since for binary search is to find the half and keep dividing the half to other halfs. For that binary search is O(n/2). 
    - We can take the size of the array 100,000 and keep dividing it by two, until it reach to a 1. 
    - The amount of steps to perform a binary search is 16 steps.
